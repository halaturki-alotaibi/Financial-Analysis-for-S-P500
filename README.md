# 🧮 Profit & Loss Analysis Across GICS Sectors in the S&P 500

This project is a financial analysis I conducted using **Microsoft Excel** to explore profit and loss trends across the **GICS sectors** in the **S&P 500** index. It was part of my journey to develop and showcase my skills in data analysis and financial reporting.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project was to provide a clear and interactive overview of financial performance—revenue, cost, and operating expenses—across various sectors in the S&P 500. The dashboard allows users to **dynamically select a sector** and view key financial indicators over multiple years.

## ✨ What I Did

- 📊 Built a fully interactive dashboard in **Excel** using:
  - `INDEX` & `MATCH` functions to create dynamic value lookups.
  - `Conditional Formatting` to highlight profitability or losses per sector.
  - Integrated **pivot tables** and **charts** to visualize sector performance trends.
  
- 🧩 Enabled users to select sectors (e.g., Real Estate, Technology, Healthcare) to filter financial metrics like:
  - Revenue
  - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
  - Operating Expenses
  - Net Profit

- 📈 Used **charts** to display the relationship between revenues and COGS, revealing how they influence profit margins.
